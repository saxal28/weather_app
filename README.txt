#### weather app ####

project checklist
      [ ] gps works for every city /n
      [x] weather box
      [x]  F/C switch
      [x] displays current city
      [x] tells if it's raining/sunny/etc
      [x] changing icons representing current weather conditions
      [x] background should change according to weather/time

Cant figure out to get GPS to work.
	-has to do with loading; variables not loading with GPS
	-returns undefined
	
	works on codepen but not git HTML preview or local
